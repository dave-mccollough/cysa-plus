# Threat Intelligence Sharing

## Security and Threat Intelligence

- Security Intelligence
  - Process where data is generated, collected, processed, analyzed and disseminated
  - Provide insights into the security status of information systems
- Cyber Threat Intelligence
  - Investigation, collection, analysis, and dissemintaiton of information about emerging threats and threat sources to provide data about the external threat landscape
    - Narrative Reports
    - Data Feeds
    - Use both
  - Most security companies produce threat intelligence reports

## Intelligence Cycle

- Requirements (Planning and direction)
  - Defines the goals for the intelligence gathering effort
  - What are the things we want to measure
- Collection and Processing
  - Implemented by software tools to gather and process data for analysis
  - Processing with convert data into standard format
- Analysis
  - Performed against the use case determined in the plannong phase
  - May use automated analysis, AI, and Machine learning
  - Known good data, known bad data, unsure
- Dissemination
  - Publish information produced
  - Consumers act on insights developed
- Feedback
  - Clarify requirements 
  - Improve the collection, analysis and dissemination of information - review current inputs and outputs
  - Lessons learned
  - Measured success
  - Evolving threat issues

## Intelligence Sources
